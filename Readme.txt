The dataset utilized in this project is sourced from the Government of Canada's Public Health Infobase for the year 2022. This dataset is focused on Covid-19 statistics and tracks daily case numbers in each Canadian province. It contains relevant information such as ID, Province name, Reporting date, Total Cases, Total Deaths, and Total Active Cases. A data-cleaning process was carried out to remove any irrelevant or null values, resulting in a dataset comprising 10,333 rows and 40 columns.

For the evaluation and analysis of the dataset, it is essential to clean it further by handling "empty" and "Null" values in certain columns, such as integers or decimals, either by removing them or filling them with default values. The process of evaluating and validating the models we build is crucial in supervised machine learning. It involves using unbiased data to create effective and reliable models. To achieve this, we divided the provided dataset into two segments: a training set and a test set, following a 70:30 ratio. The Scikit Learn train-test split function was used for this purpose. By fitting our model using the training portion of the dataset and validating it with the test portion, we can increase our confidence in its performance with new data and reduce bias in our model.
